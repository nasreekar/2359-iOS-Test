## Problems
1. Implement the ATM machine algorithm that determines the combination of the least number of bills to serve when an amount is requested. Available bills are $50,$10,$5 and $1 i.e (given $87, the system returns $50,$10,$10,$10,$5,$1,$1). Also consider how well your implementation scales when a large number is given such as $2013
2. Write, efficient code for extracting unique elements from a sorted list of array. Do no tuse language built-in features such as sort/hash/sert/dictionary/unique/filter/equal/compare. Write only basic codes using if-else, for loop etc. (Example input and output: 1,1,3,3,3,5,5,5,9,9,9,9)->(1,3,5,9)
